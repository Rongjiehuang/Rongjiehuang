## Hi there üëã

**Rongjie Huang (ÈªÑËûçÊù∞)** did my Graduate study at College of Computer Science and Software, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also obtained Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Zhejiang University. During my graduate study, I was lucky to collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Prof. Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ), and Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University. I was grateful to intern or collaborate at TikTok, Shanghai AI Lab (OpenGV Lab), Tencent Seattle Lab, Alibaba Damo Academic, with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen), [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver), [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ).

My research interest includes **Multi-Modal Generative AI, Multi-Modal Language Processing, and AI4Science**. I have published **first-author papers** at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI**. 

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.**
