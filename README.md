## Hi there üëã

**Rongjie Huang (ÈªÑËûçÊù∞)** is a Second-Year Master's student **(expected to graduate at 2024.03)** in the College of Computer Science and Software at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ). I also have a close collaboration with Speech Research Team at Zhejiang University and ByteDance ([Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) and [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver)). I am a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab (Seattle Lab)](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), where I work with [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interest includes generative AI for speech/sing/audio and spoken language processing. I have published **20+** papers at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI/ACM-MM**.

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.**

**I am now looking for full-time and internship jobs, or PhD positions. If you have openings, please contact me and I really appreciate it.**
